3,Bacterial live vector vaccines expressing chromosomally-integrated foreign antigens,2018,"Bacterial live vector vaccines represent a vaccine development strategy that offers exceptional flexibility.

The resulting reduction in shaping gain is small and becomes negligible as the rate per 2D of the constellation increases. This technique uses a structured vector quantization (SVQ) technique for optimal shaping of the constellation. Optimal (N-sphere) SVQ shaping results in higher shaping gains than those of Voronoi constellations based on known N-dimensional lattices. For a given CER.sub.2 (or PAR.sub.2) SVQ shaping results in optimal shaping. This is useful for implementation over QAM modems as significant shaping gains can be achieved even for a small constellation expansion. The SVQ-shaped constellations have a very reasonable implementation complexity. They allow for the possibility of opportunistic secondary channels, and there constituent 2D constellations are invariant to .pi./2 phase rotations (assuming cubic lattice based constellations). Compatibility of SVQ shaping with trellis coding was also demonstrated, resulting in the SVQ-shaped trellis-coded modulation scheme which can realize both shaping and coding gains.

219,Tandem refrigeration system,1995,"A refrigeration system for providing cooling to two or more compartments utilizing respective first and second evaporators. During the initial operation of a cooling cycle, the refrigerant is utilized for cooling the compartment (such as a fresh food compartment) which is to be maintained at a higher temperature as compared with another compartment (such as a freezer compartment). Cooling can thus be achieved by operating a fan in the fresh food compartment, even where the refrigeration system has not yet reached steady state after the compressor initially begins operating. After cooling has been achieved in the fresh food compartment, the refrigerant in the system has reached a state suitable for cooling of the freezer compartment, and the fan for the freezer evaporator is turned on while the fan for the fresh food compartment is turned off. As a result, a relatively simply refrigeration system is provided which is more efficient than conventional arrangements, particularly single-stage refrigeration systems. A defrosting cycle can also be accomplished with the fresh food fan operating, and with the freezer evaporator fan and compressor off. As the refrigerant evaporates in the fresh food evaporator during defrosting, a thermosiphon effect results in an exchange of refrigerant between the evaporators such that defrosting is accomplished without requiring a defrost heater.",False

476,Low frequency modulation sensors using nanosecond fluorophores,2004,"Described is a new approach to fluorescence sensing based on a mixture of fluorophores, one of which is sensitive to the desired analyte. If a long lifetime analyte-insensitive fluorophore is mixed with a short lifetime analyte-sensitive fluorophore, the modulation of the emission at conveniently low frequencies becomes equal to the fractional fluorescence intensity of the sensing fluorophore. Under these conditions the modulation can be used to determine the analyte concentration. This can be used with any fluorophore which changes intensity in response to analyte, and does not require the sensing fluorophore to display a change in lifetime. The feasibility of modulation-based sensing was demonstrated using mixtures of 6-carboxyfluorescein and [Ru2,2&#8242;(bipyridyl)3]2+ as a pH sensor and of the calcium probe Fluo-3 and [Ru2,2&#8242;(bipyridyl)3]2+ as a calcium sensor.",False

Another stereoisomer of (3R,3′R)-zeaxanthin that is not of dietary origin but is found in the human ocular tissues is (3R,3′S;meso)-zeaxanthin. There is growing evidence that these carotenoids play an important role in the prevention of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that is the leading cause of blindness in the U.S. and the Western World.

(3R)-β-Cryptoxanthin and (3R,6′R)-α-cryptoxanthin are two rare food carotenoids that are not commercially available and the former exhibits vitamin A activity. In the first synthetic step, commercially available lutein and/or lutein esters are transformed into a mixture of dehydration products of lutein (anhydroluteins) in the presence of a catalytic amount of an acid. The resulting anhydroluteins are then converted to (3R)-β-cryptoxanthin (major product) and (3R,6′R)-α-cryptoxanthin (minor product) by heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation employing transition elements of group VIII (Pt, Pd, Rh supported on alumina or carbon) in a variety of organic solvents under atmospheric pressure of hydrogen and at temperatures ranging from −15° C. to 40° C. Among these catalysts, Pt supported on alumina at 40° C. in ethyl acetate provides the best yield of (3R)-β-cryptoxanthin and (3R,6′R)-α-cryptoxanthin. Several homogeneous catalysts can also promote the regioselective hydrogenation of anhydroluteins to a mixture of (3R)-β-cryptoxanthin and (3R,6′R)-α-cryptoxanthin in low to moderate yields.
